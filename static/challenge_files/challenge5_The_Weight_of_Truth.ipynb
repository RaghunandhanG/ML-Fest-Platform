    "*\"We have a situation,\"* she said, sliding a folder across the table. *\"Our core prediction engine — the one that drives all downstream decisions — was built by a mathematician who left the company years ago. He didn't document anything. No saved model, no training logs, no notes. All we have is the data he used.\"*\n",
